            Believe it or not, there was a time when Anfield was the home of the Blues and not the Reds! Everton were one of the first members of the Football League but when they were evicted from Anfield in 1892, stadium owner John Houlding was left with an empty ground and no team to play in it. So Houlding decided to form his own team and, on 3 June 1892, Liverpool Football Club was born.

            Liverpool won their first ever League Championship in 1901. A run of nine wins and three draws from their final twelve matches saw the Reds crowned champions. The team were given a heroes welcome when they returned to the city with the trophy and captain Alex Raisbeck was carried through the streets on the shoulders of fans!

            Liverpool played their first ever FA Cup final in 1914. The game was played at Crystal Palace in front of 72,778 spectators, one of whom was King of England, George V. Sadly, the Reds could not win the cup and were defeated 1-0 by Burnley.

            One of the finest players to ever pull on the Red jersey signed for Liverpool in 1938. Billy Liddell joined the club as an exciting 15-year-old, though the second World War meant that his official debut for the Reds did not arrive until 1946. However, the the Scotland international soon became one of the first heroes of the Kop, who nicknamed the team 'Liddellpool' in his honour. Liddell scored over 200 goals for Liverpool and, amazingly, he never received a yellow card during his time at Anfield!

            In December 1959, Bill Shankly was appointed as the manager of Liverpool FC. The Scotsman's impact was instant and he transformed the club into one of the strongest teams in Europe. Many believe Shankly is the greatest manager in the history of the Reds, and he is almost as well remembered for his quotes, such as "If Everton were playing at the bottom of the garden, I'd pull the curtains", as he is for his trophy successes!

            It may be hard to believe but Liverpool have not always played in an all-red kit. In fact, it wasn't until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to replace the white shorts and socks with red ones as he felt an all-red kit strip would make his players look more scary to the opposition! So, in December 1964 Liverpool wore all-red for the first time in a European Cup match with Anderlecht, changing the image of football forever.

            Wembley was the venue as Liverpool recorded their first ever FA Cup final success. After a goalless 90 minutes, Roger Hunt gave the Reds an early extra-time lead but Billy Bremner equalised for Leeds soon after. However, in the 113th minute, Ian St John scored with a diving header and the cup was heading to Liverpool. Amazingly, Reds defender Gerry Byrne played for most of the match with a broken collarbone!

            Bill Shankly guided Liverpool to a UEFA Cup final win over Borussia Monchengladbach. The tie was played over two-legs, with the first match taking place at Anfield. Two goals from Kevin Keegan and one from Larry Lloyd gave Liverpool a 3-0 victory. The Reds had to survive a scare in the return match in Germany as Monchengladbach scored two first-half goals. However, Liverpool were able to see out the rest of the game and win the trophy.

            Bill Shankly stunned fans by announcing his decision to retire from his position as manager. The Scotsman won three league titles, two FA Cups and one UEFA Cup during his 15-year spell as Anfield boss. Shankly's replacement wasn't a bad one as Liverpool turned to Bob Paisley, who went on to become the most successful manager in the history of the club!

            1973 was a significant year for Liverpool FC, under the leadership of Bill Shankly they won their first European honour – the UEFA Cup – and their eighth league title! Just a year later Shankly made the decision to leave the club by mutual consent – much to the shock of all the Reds adoring fans.

            Over 20,000 Scousers made their way to Rome to watch Liverpool lift their first ever European Cup. Just like the UEFA Cup final of 1973, Borussia Monchengladbach were the opponents once again, but this time the result was never in doubt. Monchengladbach cancelled out Terry McDermott's opening strike, however second-half goals from Tommy Smith and Phil Neal meant the European Cup was heading for Anfield as Bob Paisley's Reds ran out 3-1 winners.

            Liverpool retained the European Cup by beating Club Brugge at Wembley. Kenny Dalglish scored the only goal of the game with a brilliant chip to cap an excellent debut season at Anfield. The Scottish international had been signed by Bob Paisley as a replacement for Kevin Keegan. He went on to make over 500 appearances for Liverpool and later became the manager of the team. He is regarded by many to be the finest player to have ever pulled on the Red jersey.

            Paris was the setting for Liverpool's third European Cup final victory. Despite finishing 5th in the league, Alan Kennedy's late goal gave the Reds a 1-0 victory over the mighty Real Madrid. Liverpool also won the League Cup in 1981, beating West Ham United.

            After 44 years as a player, coach and manager of Liverpool, Bob Paisley retired. Paisley won an astonishing three European Cups, six league titles, three League Cups, one UEFA Cup, one European Super Cup and five Charity Shields during his time as Reds boss making him the most successful manager in the history of the club. He became part of the Liverpool board after his retirement but sadly passed away in 1996.

            Joe Fagan led Liverpool to an historic treble in his first season in charge. After lifting the League Championship and League Cup, the Reds won one of the most exciting European Cup finals of all time by beating AS Roma in their home stadium on penalties. Alan Kennedy was the hero once again after netting the winning penalty, but the antics of Bruce Grobbelaar will always be remembered as the Liverpool goalie wobbled his legs in an attempt to put off the Roma penalty takers!

            29 May 1985 is one of the saddest days in the history of Liverpool Football Club. On what should have been a happy occasion as Liverpool took on Juventus in the European Cup final at the Heysel Stadium in Belgium, 39 fans of the Italian team died after fighting in the stands caused a wall to collapse. In Memoria e Amicizia, in Memory and Friendship.

            Liverpool claimed a league and FA Cup double in Kenny Dalglish's first-season as player-manager. The Reds won eight of their last nine games to see off the challenge of neighbours Everton and clinch their 16th League Championship - and it was Dalglish who scored the goal that secured the title with a winning strike against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on the final day. The following week, Liverpool beat Everton 3-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley to leave the Blues feeling even more miserable!

            Liverpool secured their 18th League Championship in 1990 - and they did it with two games to spare. Aston Villa's 3-3 home draw with Norwich City ensured Kenny Dalglish's men were champions once again after a 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers. Amongst the highlights of the campaign was a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace in John Aldridge's Kop farewell. Alan Hansen, in his last season as a Liverpool player, appropriately lifted the trophy.

            Liverpool won their fifth FA Cup by beating Sunderland 2-0 in the final at Wembley. Steve McManaman returned from injury to put in a man-of-the-match performance and it was the Scouse winger who set-up Michael Thomas for the Reds' opening goal. Ian Rush claimed the second to clinch Graeme Souness' only trophy as Liverpool manager.

            Steve McManaman helped Liverpool to the League Cup in a 2-1 win over Bolton. The Kirkdale-born wing-wizard opened the scoring in the first-half after gliding past two defenders before curling the ball beyond the goalkeeper. McManaman netted his second and the winning goal after half-time as he jinked his way through the Bolton defence and scored with a low shot to claim the trophy for the Reds.

            Liverpool won an astonishing three trophies in one season, collecting the FA, UEFA and League Cups. Birmingham were defeated in the League Cup final before two late Michael Owen goals defeated Arsenal in the FA Cup, but the best was yet to come as the Reds beat Spanish club Alaves 5-4 in a crazy game in Dortmund. Champions League qualification was also secured on the final day of the season to bring an unbelievable campaign to an end for manager Gerard Houllier.

            Rafael Benitez was appointed manager in July 2004, taking over from Gerard Houllier at Anfield. He arrived in Liverpool from Valencia, fresh from winning the league title and UEFA Cup with the Spanish side. Benitez moved quickly in the transfer market to sign fellow Spaniard's Xabi Alonso and Luis Garcia and begin his 'Rafalution'.

            Liverpool claimed their fifth European Cup after a memorable triumph over AC Milan. The Reds had overcome all odds to reach the final, but were losing 3-0 by half-time. However, an incredible second-half saw goals from Gerrard, Smicer and Alonso drew Liverpool level before they went on to win the cup on penalties. An unforgettable homecoming followed and the trophy returned to Anfield, where it would remain as Liverpool had won it for keeps!

            Liverpool won their 7th FA Cup against West Ham in a dramatic game in Cardiff. Just a year after Istanbul, the Reds were at it again. After going 2-0 down, goals from Djibril Cisse and Steven Gerrard levelled the score at 2-2 before the Hammers retook the lead. But, with just seconds remaining, Gerrard struck a magnificent 35-yard volley to force extra-time and later penalties, where Pepe Reina saved three spot-kicks to win the trophy for Liverpool in what will forever be known as the 'Gerrard final'.

The 23-year-old became an instant hero on the Kop as he scored on his Anfield debut against Chelsea. Torres went on to break several records in his first season at Liverpool, scoring an amazing 33 goals in all competitions!

            Liverpool appointed Roy Hodgson as their new manager in July 2010. The former Fulham, Inter Milan and Switzerland manager agreed a three-year contract with the club to become the 18th manager in the Reds' history. He said: "This is the biggest job in club football and I'm honoured to be taking on the role of manager of Britain's most successful football club." 
            On Friday, 15 October 2010, New England Sports Ventures announced they had purchased Liverpool FC. NESV principal owner John Henry said: "We are committed first and foremost to winning. We have a history of winning, and today we want LFC supporters to know that this approach is what we intend to bring to this great club."
